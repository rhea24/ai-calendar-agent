# ai-calendar-agent

Built this to tinker with the OpenAI API and learn about structured outputs and function calling. 

This AI Calendar Agent goes through the most recent emails in your gmail inbox and checks if they contain an invite for a meeting of some sort. If it does, the agent adds it to your google calendar with the information (name/date/time/location/description) filled out based on the contents of the email.
